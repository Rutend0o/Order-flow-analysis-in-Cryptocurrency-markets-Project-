# Order-flow-analysis-in-Cryptocurrency-markets-Project-
This project aims to explore the relationship between order flow and price dynamics in the Cryptocurrency markets. The underlying premise is that the balance of buy and sell orders provides key information about market sentiment, which in turn drives price changes. When there is a significant imbalance, either in favor of buyers or sellers, it can signal upcoming shifts in price as liquidity adjusts and market participants react to perceived over- or undervaluation. This project will empirically assess these relationships through a combination of exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling.
